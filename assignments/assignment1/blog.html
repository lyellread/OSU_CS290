		<h4>Blog Entry 1 - 4/3/2019 - Assignment 1</h4>
		<p>
			Assignment 1 was reasonably simple to complete. Even having never written HTML before, I picked it up pretty fast and was able to put together a simple set of HTML only webpages in about an hour. Some of the challenges that I encountered were that I had deleted my /public_html folder at a past date, inadvertantly, and had to fix that, and I also had to work out the UNIX permisssions for the  files stored in that aforementionned directory to ensure that they were visible to the public, as the assignment reqired.

			As far as learnings from this assignment, I learned everything I did - that is to say I did not have any previous knowledge of HTML. I used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE" target="_blank">a video guide to HTML</a> to aid in my learning. I already knew how to use GitHub.
